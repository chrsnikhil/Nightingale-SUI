## 🎯 What Makes Knightingale Different?

> Web3 is full of wrappers and half-baked ideas. We wanted to build something real.

Knightingale is one of the few **fully-functional**, fully-deployed **multiplayer PvP games** in the space that actually:

- **Uses blockchain features to enhance gameplay**
- **Works right now — not “coming soon”**
- **Proves the power of Sui for real-time games**

---

## 💬 Notes for Judges

We’ve seen many projects present mockups or AI-powered wrappers during hackathons. This is not that.

Knightingale is a fully working game with:
- Wallet-based wagering and payouts
- Live leaderboard
- Real gameplay loop
- Functional store and minting logic
- Sui smart contracts deployed and tested

It’s built to show how blockchain can empower real games, not complicate them.
